# AgoraAI Venture  
### Reasoning-based project co-construction with AI

AgoraAI Venture is a project designed to support the **conceptualisation, analysis and evaluation of economic and social initiatives** through a structured, dialogic and reasoning-based process.

It is **not** an automatic business plan generator.  
Its purpose is to help proponents **think through a project**, make assumptions explicit, explore alternatives and arrive at coherent, interpretable results.

## What AgoraAI Venture is today (v3)

AgoraAI Venture v3 represents a **conceptual shift** from earlier versions.

The system is built around:
- a **dialogic interaction** with the project proponent  
- a **multi-agent reasoning engine** representing different perspectives  
- an explicit focus on **assumptions, constraints and drivers**  
- a process in which **numbers emerge from reasoning**, not the opposite  

The project is co-constructed through interaction:  
the proponent remains central, while AI agents support clarification, critical reflection and synthesis.

## What it is NOT

AgoraAI Venture:
- is not a black-box optimizer  
- does not automate decisions  
- does not promise predictions  
- does not replace human judgement  

AI is used as a **cognitive support tool**, not as a decision-maker.

## From reasoning to numbers

Starting from reasoning does not mean renouncing quantitative rigor.

On the contrary, the system is designed so that:
- economic drivers are explicitly defined  
- cause–effect relationships are traceable  
- assumptions are visible and revisable  
- numerical outputs are coherent and verifiable  

The reasoning process makes calculations **interpretable, controllable and correctable**.

---

## Outputs

Depending on the context, the process may generate:
- project analyses  
- feasibility studies  
- synthesis reports  
- business plans  

These documents are **not the goal**, but the trace of the reasoning process that produced them.
